Hey there! Iâ€™m a budding roboticist pursuing my master's in Robotic System Development at the Robotics Insitute at Carnegie Mellon University. I am passionate about Robotics and AI and have experience in SLAM, CV, ROS, embedded systems, electronics, and AI. 
I love to explore different technologies and apply them to solve real-world problems. Come join me in my journey to wire the unwired :P.
 <!-- Currently I am working on:
- Autonomous Vehicles 
- reinforcement learning
- control systems -->
