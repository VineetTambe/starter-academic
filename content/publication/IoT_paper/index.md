abstract: "In this paper, we provide an outlook for various protocols that are used for the transmission of
data in the communication layer and provide an overview and analysis of device reliability
from the point of view of the perception layer. We present an analysis on design metrics like
perception, communication and computation layers for a “constrained environment”. An
environment with limited resources such as - limited power, bandwidth, compute, memory etc.
can be classified as a constrained environment. Based on our literature survey we have also
presented a study that shows multi-path routing is more efficient than single-path and the
retransmission mechanism is not preferable in an IoT environment. We have also tested the
performance of standard security algorithms on different computational architectures and
discuss the implications of the results. Empirical results demonstrate that encryption &
decryption times increase non-linearly rather than linearly as message size increases."
